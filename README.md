#BORIS BIKES


##WHAT IS IT
------------------------

Boris Bikes is a free software for simulating a bike rental system including a network of docking stations and bikes that anyone can use.

The purpose of the Boris Bikes software is for the user to get an overview of how to such a bike-rental system could work in real life and to get inspiration of how such a system could be built up in code, using Ruby.

By running the software you can simulate the features of the system such as checking bike availabilty on a docking station, rent a bike, returning it and so on.

By checking out the code in the /lib folder and the tests in the /spec folder you can get a better understanding of how we solved different technical challenges.
